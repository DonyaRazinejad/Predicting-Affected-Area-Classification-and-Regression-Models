Predicting Regional Impact: Integrating Binary and Continuous Decision-Making with Python

This assignment involves estimating whether or not a region will be affected by undetermined parameters, and if yes, how much of the area will be affected. The issue at hand is practicing Python coding for an assignment to learn how to connect binary and continuous decision-making to one another. This project evaluates the predictive performance using various metrics. The ROC curve illustrates the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates. Additionally, the area under the curve (AUC) is calculated to quantify the model's discriminative ability. For continuous predictions, R-squared (R2) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are computed to assess the goodness of fit and the accuracy of the model's predictions, respectively.
